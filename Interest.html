    <div><img src="DSC05059-ARW_DxO_DeepPRIME.jpg" alt="Kingfisher Perching"></div>
    <p>I love to explore Wildlife and nature through my lens.
      I have been doing photography for around a year and a half now.
      and has really helped with my mental welbeing. 
      my favourite subject to photograph is a Barn Owl, Due to them coming out during dusk, 
      it is a naturally peaceful time in the day

<p>I love playing Games! 
  All kinds in fact, this ranges from video games, card games and board games. 
  I have been gaming more of my life then not now, with my first console being the sega megadrive.
  Currently my favourite game is Dota 2 (defence of the ancients 2). i have dabbled in creating games myself using unity and c#, however this is a work in progress and has been put on the back burner.
